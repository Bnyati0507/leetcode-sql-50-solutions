-- Title: Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher
-- ID: Q16
-- Difficulty: Easy
-- Concepts: GROUP BY, COUNT(DISTINCT)
-- Schema:
--   Teacher(teacher_id INT, subject_id INT, dept_id INT)
--     (Each row indicates a teacher teaches a subject in a department.)
-- Problem (paraphrased):
--   - For each teacher, count how many unique subjects they teach (across all departments).
--   - Return teacher_id and the count of distinct subjects.

-- Solution:
SELECT
  teacher_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;

-- Explanation:
-- 1. GROUP BY teacher_id → allows aggregation per teacher.
-- 2. COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) → counts unique subject IDs per teacher.
-- 3. We return teacher_id and cnt (number of unique subjects).

-- Note:
-- DEPT_ID is ignored because we only care about unique subjects, regardless of department.
